<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">Using digital virtual information accessible through a QR code in packaging has several advantages over traditional labeling. </p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">Here are some of the main advantages:</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color"><strong>Space-saving:</strong> QR codes take up much less space than traditional labeling, which can be especially beneficial for smaller packaging. This allows for more room for design elements and branding on the packaging itself.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color"><strong>More Information:</strong> QR codes allow for much more information to be provided than traditional labeling. This can include detailed product information, instructions, links to additional resources, and even customer reviews. QR codes can also be updated in real-time, allowing for up-to-date information to be provided to customers.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color"><strong>Design:</strong> By putting much of the regulations off the label, this reduces visual noise,&nbsp;giving more prominence to the design. </p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color"><strong>Interactive:</strong> QR codes allow for a more interactive experience for customers. Customers can scan the code to access videos, images, and other interactive content that can enhance their experience with the product.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color"><strong>Engagement:</strong> QR codes can be used to engage customers with interactive content, such as videos, games, and surveys.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color"><strong>Environmentally-friendly:</strong> QR codes can help reduce waste by eliminating the need for multiple paper labels. This is especially important for companies looking to reduce their environmental impact.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color"><strong>Cost-effective: </strong>QR codes can be printed on packaging at no additional cost, making them a cost-effective way to provide additional information to customers.</p>
