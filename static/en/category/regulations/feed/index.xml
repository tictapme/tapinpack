<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">If you are a producer or consumer of alcoholic beverages, you should be aware of the new European regulation 2023 that regulates the labeling of these products. The aim of this regulation is to improve consumer information and to prevent misleading or confusing practices by manufacturers.</p>
</div></div>



<h4 class="has-ast-global-color-1-color has-text-color">What information should be included on the label of an alcoholic beverage?</h4>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">Under the new rules, all alcoholic beverages with a volume of alcohol greater than 1.2% must include on the label the following data: </p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">&#8211; <strong>Name or denomination</strong>(origin) of the drink: must indicate the type of drink it is (wine, beer, liquor, etc.). </p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">&#8211; Name of the <strong>manufacturer</strong>: You must clearly identify who made the drink and where your headquarters or establishment are. </p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">&#8211; <strong>If it contains allergens</strong> or if it can cause adverse reactions: you should warn the consumer if the drink contains any ingredient that can cause an allergic reaction or intolerance (such as sulfites, gluten, lactose, etc.). </p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">&#8211; A symbol indicating the low <strong>alcohol content (between 2% and 6%) or high (more than 6%)</strong>: it must inform the consumer about the alcohol content of the drink and its possible health effects.</p>



<h4 class="has-ast-global-color-1-color has-text-color">What benefits does this regulation have for consumers?</h4>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">This regulation has several benefits for consumers:</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">On the one hand, it raises the level of protection and reduces errors in the perception of the drink due to incorrect labeling: it prevents the consumer from becoming confused about the type, origin, or quality of the drink he buys or consumes.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">It also seeks <strong>to prevent misleading practices by alcohol companies</strong>: it prevents companies from using false or misleading names, images, or claims to attract or mislead consumers.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">It also calls for <strong>greater market transparency and fair competition</strong>: it ensures that all producers and distributors comply with the same rules and conditions and respect consumers&#8217; rights and interests.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">The idea is that<strong> it allows for more informed and health-conscious decisions:</strong>by including nutritional information and allergens, consumers can better understand the energy value, nutrients and substances that can affect their health (such as sugars, saturated fats, or salt) that each drink contains.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">If you want to know more about the solution that Tapinpack offers for compliance with this regulation, do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
