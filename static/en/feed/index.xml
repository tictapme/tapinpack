<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">The labeling of alcoholic beverages is a critical issue for any producer. Not only is it indispensable to comply with government regulations, but it is also an <strong>effective way to promote the product, stand out from the competition, and provide useful information to the consumer.</strong> However, for a label to be effective, it must meet certain requirements and best practices. </p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">Here are five tips for efficient labeling of alcoholic beverages.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-0-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>clear and concise information</strong></p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">The first step to good labelling is to provide clear and concise information. The first step to good labeling is to provide clear and accurate information. This must include the name of the product, the net content of the bottle, the percentage of alcohol by volume, and the name and address of the manufacturer or importer. In addition, you should provide information on any allergens that may be present in the product.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-0-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>Attractive design</strong></p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">The label of a bottle of an alcoholic drink is also a marketing tool and therefore <strong>the design of the label should be attractive and informative</strong>. The design should reflect the personality of the product and the brand. The choice of color and typography should be attractive, but also readable and easy to understand. It is the visible face of the packaged product that has the double task of standing out from the competition and <strong>defining the brand.</strong> Digital labeling now achieves greater hegemony in design by deriving mandatory information outside the physical label accessible through a QR code, avoiding visual noise, and offering the possibility for the design to stand out and breathe.</p>



<p></p>



<div class="wp-block-uagb-image alignright uagb-block-79257284 wp-block-uagb-image--layout-default wp-block-uagb-image--effect-static wp-block-uagb-image--align-right"><figure class="wp-block-uagb-image__figure"><img decoding="async" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/dagnele-en-Pixabay-wine.jpg  " src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/dagnele-en-Pixabay-wine.jpg" alt="Bottle with a blank question mark. By Dagnele at Pixabay" class="uag-image-1299" width="" height="" title="" loading="lazy"></figure></div>



<p></p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-0-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>Must comply with the regulations</strong></p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">The labeling of alcoholic beverages is highly regulated. Manufacturers must comply with all <strong>regulations and requirements stipulated by regulatory authorities.</strong> This means including mandatory information and restrictions. However, there is a ban on adding misleading information. Good labeling of alcohol bottles is a matter of transparency and responsibility on the part of manufacturers.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-0-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>Making the most of available space</strong></p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">The labeling of an alcoholic beverage bottle should take full advantage of the available space. <strong>Space is limited</strong>, so each item on the label must be carefully selected to provide the most important information. <strong>The size and location of the information</strong> are also important for the consumer to quickly find what they need. Digital labeling results in less saturation of information, and may give greater prominence to design.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-0-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>Ease of use</strong></p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">Finally, labelling should be easy to use. The information must be <strong>logically organized and easy to understand</strong>. Technical terms and language should be clear and concise, which can contribute to improving consumer confidence in their products. In addition, labeling must be durable and durable to withstand handling and transport.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">In conclusion,<strong> the labeling of alcoholic beverages is a critical aspect of the beverage production process. Effective labeling not only meets government requirements but is also an effective way to market and promote the product, it also becomes the recognizable face that sets you apart from other brands. </strong></p>

<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">Design plays a crucial role in the labeling of alcoholic beverages, especially wine. <strong>The label is the first point of contact with the customer</strong>, and it is through the design that the brand can create a memorable impression on the consumer. he design is not just about making the label look good; it&#8217;s about telling a story and conveying important information about the product. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-post-featured-image"><img width="561" height="285" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Design.png" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Design.png 561w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Design-300x152.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px" /></figure>


<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">The design on the label is very important, and here we explain the main reasons. It should also be noted that virtual labels can improve this design becoming a very powerful tool for the benefit of the consumer.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">Firstly, <strong>a wine label should reflect the quality and character of the wine it represents</strong>. The design should be able to <strong>convey the taste, aroma, and color of the wine, and the story behind its production.</strong> Wine is often associated with luxury and sophistication, and the design should reflect this. <strong>A well-designed label can create an emotional connection with the customer and help them understand the value of the wine.</strong></p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">Secondly, <strong>a wine label should be informati</strong>ve. It should provide all the necessary information about the wine, including the name, vintage, alcohol content, region, and producer. The label should also include any legal requirements, such as government warnings and allergen information. By providing all the necessary information, the customer can make an informed decision about whether to buy the wine or not.<br>Virtual tags can benefit the consumer by providing additional information that cannot be included in the physical label. This information could include tasting notes, food pairing suggestions, and even virtual tours of the winery. By providing this information, the consumer can make a more informed decision about the wine and enhance their overall experience.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">Furthermore, virtual labels can also be easily updated, allowing wineries to change information about their wine without the need for a new physical label.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">In conclusion, design plays a crucial role in labeling alcoholic drinks, particularly wine. A well-designed label can create an emotional connection with the consumer and convey important information about the product. Virtual labels can also benefit the consumer by providing additional information and offering a more sustainable option for wine labeling. <strong>By investing in a well-designed label, wineries can enhance the overall customer experience and create a lasting impression on the consumer.</strong></p>

<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">Is <strong>digital labeling</strong> better than <strong>traditional labeling</strong>?</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">Using digital virtual information accessible through a QR code in packaging has several advantages over traditional labeling. </p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">Here are some of the main advantages:</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color"><strong>Space-saving:</strong> QR codes take up much less space than traditional labeling, which can be especially beneficial for smaller packaging. This allows for more room for design elements and branding on the packaging itself.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color"><strong>More Information:</strong> QR codes allow for much more information to be provided than traditional labeling. This can include detailed product information, instructions, links to additional resources, and even customer reviews. QR codes can also be updated in real-time, allowing for up-to-date information to be provided to customers.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color"><strong>Design:</strong> By putting much of the regulations off the label, this reduces visual noise,&nbsp;giving more prominence to the design. </p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color"><strong>Interactive:</strong> QR codes allow for a more interactive experience for customers. Customers can scan the code to access videos, images, and other interactive content that can enhance their experience with the product.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color"><strong>Engagement:</strong> QR codes can be used to engage customers with interactive content, such as videos, games, and surveys.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color"><strong>Environmentally-friendly:</strong> QR codes can help reduce waste by eliminating the need for multiple paper labels. This is especially important for companies looking to reduce their environmental impact.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color"><strong>Cost-effective: </strong>QR codes can be printed on packaging at no additional cost, making them a cost-effective way to provide additional information to customers.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">Overall, digital virtual information accessible through a QR code offers several advantages over traditional labeling, including more information, interactivity, and traceability, while also being more space-saving, environmentally-friendly, and cost-effective.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">If you want to know more about digital labeling, do not hesitate to contact Tapinpack.</p>

<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">The European Union has very strict regulations regarding the information that alcoholic beverages must show to protect the health of consumers and ensure greater transparency in the market. Here we describe the information required by European Union legislation on alcoholic beverages.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color"><strong>Nutritional information and list of ingredients</strong></p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">As indicated by the new European Regulation, in order to provide consumers with a higher level of information (Article 119 of Regulation (EU) No. 1308/2013) labels must include nutritional information and a list of ingredients. This includes the amount of energy, fats, saturated fats, carbohydrates, sugars, proteins, and salt in the drink. Additional information about vitamins and minerals may also be included.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">This measure aims to help consumers make more informed decisions about their diet and avoid excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color"><strong>Health warnings</strong></p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">Since 13 December 2014, all alcoholic beverages sold in the European Union <strong>must display health warnings on their labels</strong> which <strong>a</strong>im to raise consumers&#8217; awareness of the risks of alcohol abuse and promote responsible consumption.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">These warnings should include the <strong>amount of alcohol in the drink</strong>, along with messages that warn of the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption, such as: &#8220;Alcohol abuse is harmful to health&#8221;.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color"><strong>Allergies and intolerances</strong></p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">The New Regulation does not replace the previous regulation in this field.  </p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-0-color has-text-color">&lt;&lt;However, the option not to provide full nutritional information on the package or on a label subject to it should not affect the existing requirement to list on the label substances that cause allergies or intolerances. &gt;&gt;</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">  This means that even if digital labeling is chosen, allergies and intolerances must be present on the physical label.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-0-color has-text-color">&lt;&lt;substances or products that may cause allergies or intolerances and the terms to be used to indicate them on the label of foodstuffs are those listed in Annex II of the said Regulation. &gt;&gt; Regulation (EU) No. 1169/2011</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">Not only is presence mandatory, but it must also be displayed in multiple languages.  </p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-0-color has-text-color"><em>&lt;&lt;Wine products produced in the Union are exported to third countries. In order to ensure that consumers in these countries understand the information related to the product they are buying, it should be possible to have the label translated into the languages of the importing country&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.</em>  DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2019/ 33</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color"></p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color"><strong>Origin and content</strong></p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">From 1 January 2019, all alcoholic beverages sold in the European Union must display <strong>information about their origin and content on their labels</strong>, with the aim of ensuring transparency in the market and protecting consumers against food fraud<strong>.</strong></p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">This includes information on the region of production, the country of origin and the variety of grapes used in the case of wines.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">In conclusion, the European Union has very strict regulations regarding the information that alcoholic beverages must show on their labels. This information includes nutritional information, health warnings, information on allergies and intolerances, origin, and content. These measures aim to protect consumer health, promote responsible consumption and ensure market transparency.</p>

<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">If you are a producer or consumer of alcoholic beverages, you should be aware of the new European regulation 2023 that regulates the labeling of these products. The aim of this regulation is to improve consumer information and to prevent misleading or confusing practices by manufacturers.</p>
</div></div>



<h4 class="has-ast-global-color-1-color has-text-color">What information should be included on the label of an alcoholic beverage?</h4>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">Under the new rules, all alcoholic beverages with a volume of alcohol greater than 1.2% must include on the label the following data: </p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">&#8211; <strong>Name or denomination</strong>(origin) of the drink: must indicate the type of drink it is (wine, beer, liquor, etc.). </p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">&#8211; Name of the <strong>manufacturer</strong>: You must clearly identify who made the drink and where your headquarters or establishment are. </p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">&#8211; <strong>If it contains allergens</strong> or if it can cause adverse reactions: you should warn the consumer if the drink contains any ingredient that can cause an allergic reaction or intolerance (such as sulfites, gluten, lactose, etc.). </p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">&#8211; A symbol indicating the low <strong>alcohol content (between 2% and 6%) or high (more than 6%)</strong>: it must inform the consumer about the alcohol content of the drink and its possible health effects.</p>



<h4 class="has-ast-global-color-1-color has-text-color">What benefits does this regulation have for consumers?</h4>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">This regulation has several benefits for consumers:</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">On the one hand, it raises the level of protection and reduces errors in the perception of the drink due to incorrect labeling: it prevents the consumer from becoming confused about the type, origin, or quality of the drink he buys or consumes.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">It also seeks <strong>to prevent misleading practices by alcohol companies</strong>: it prevents companies from using false or misleading names, images, or claims to attract or mislead consumers.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">It also calls for <strong>greater market transparency and fair competition</strong>: it ensures that all producers and distributors comply with the same rules and conditions and respect consumers&#8217; rights and interests.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">The idea is that<strong> it allows for more informed and health-conscious decisions:</strong>by including nutritional information and allergens, consumers can better understand the energy value, nutrients and substances that can affect their health (such as sugars, saturated fats, or salt) that each drink contains.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">If you want to know more about the solution that Tapinpack offers for compliance with this regulation, do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
