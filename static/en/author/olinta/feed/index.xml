<p>Design plays a crucial role in the labeling of alcoholic beverages, especially wine. <strong>The label is the first point of contact with the customer</strong>, and it is through the design that the brand can create a memorable impression on the consumer. he design is not just about making the label look good; it&#8217;s about telling a story and conveying important information about the product. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-post-featured-image"><img width="561" height="285" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Design.png" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Design.png 561w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Design-300x152.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px" /></figure>


<p>The design on the label is very important, and here we explain the main reasons. It should also be noted that virtual labels can improve this design becoming a very powerful tool for the benefit of the consumer.</p>



<p>Firstly, <strong>a wine label should reflect the quality and character of the wine it represents</strong>. The design should be able to <strong>convey the taste, aroma, and color of the wine, and the story behind its production.</strong> Wine is often associated with luxury and sophistication, and the design should reflect this. <strong>A well-designed label can create an emotional connection with the customer and help them understand the value of the wine.</strong></p>



<p>Secondly, <strong>a wine label should be informati</strong>ve. It should provide all the necessary information about the wine, including the name, vintage, alcohol content, region, and producer. The label should also include any legal requirements, such as government warnings and allergen information. By providing all the necessary information, the customer can make an informed decision about whether to buy the wine or not.<br>Virtual tags can benefit the consumer by providing additional information that cannot be included in the physical label. This information could include tasting notes, food pairing suggestions, and even virtual tours of the winery. By providing this information, the consumer can make a more informed decision about the wine and enhance their overall experience.</p>



<p>Furthermore, virtual labels can also be easily updated, allowing wineries to change information about their wine without the need for a new physical label.</p>



<p>In conclusion, design plays a crucial role in labeling alcoholic drinks, particularly wine. A well-designed label can create an emotional connection with the consumer and convey important information about the product. Virtual labels can also benefit the consumer by providing additional information and offering a more sustainable option for wine labeling. <strong>By investing in a well-designed label, wineries can enhance the overall customer experience and create a lasting impression on the consumer.</strong></p>

<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">Using digital virtual information accessible through a QR code in packaging has several advantages over traditional labeling. </p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color">Here are some of the main advantages:</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color"><strong>Space-saving:</strong> QR codes take up much less space than traditional labeling, which can be especially beneficial for smaller packaging. This allows for more room for design elements and branding on the packaging itself.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color"><strong>More Information:</strong> QR codes allow for much more information to be provided than traditional labeling. This can include detailed product information, instructions, links to additional resources, and even customer reviews. QR codes can also be updated in real-time, allowing for up-to-date information to be provided to customers.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color"><strong>Design:</strong> By putting much of the regulations off the label, this reduces visual noise,&nbsp;giving more prominence to the design. </p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color"><strong>Interactive:</strong> QR codes allow for a more interactive experience for customers. Customers can scan the code to access videos, images, and other interactive content that can enhance their experience with the product.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color"><strong>Engagement:</strong> QR codes can be used to engage customers with interactive content, such as videos, games, and surveys.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color"><strong>Environmentally-friendly:</strong> QR codes can help reduce waste by eliminating the need for multiple paper labels. This is especially important for companies looking to reduce their environmental impact.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-8-color has-text-color"><strong>Cost-effective: </strong>QR codes can be printed on packaging at no additional cost, making them a cost-effective way to provide additional information to customers.</p>

<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">If you are a producer or consumer of alcoholic beverages, you should be aware of the new European regulation 2023 that regulates the labeling of these products. The aim of this regulation is to improve consumer information and to prevent misleading or confusing practices by manufacturers.</p>
</div></div>



<h4 class="has-ast-global-color-1-color has-text-color">What information should be included on the label of an alcoholic beverage?</h4>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">Under the new rules, all alcoholic beverages with a volume of alcohol greater than 1.2% must include on the label the following data: </p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">&#8211; <strong>Name or denomination</strong>(origin) of the drink: must indicate the type of drink it is (wine, beer, liquor, etc.). </p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">&#8211; Name of the <strong>manufacturer</strong>: You must clearly identify who made the drink and where your headquarters or establishment are. </p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">&#8211; <strong>If it contains allergens</strong> or if it can cause adverse reactions: you should warn the consumer if the drink contains any ingredient that can cause an allergic reaction or intolerance (such as sulfites, gluten, lactose, etc.). </p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">&#8211; A symbol indicating the low <strong>alcohol content (between 2% and 6%) or high (more than 6%)</strong>: it must inform the consumer about the alcohol content of the drink and its possible health effects.</p>



<h4 class="has-ast-global-color-1-color has-text-color">What benefits does this regulation have for consumers?</h4>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">This regulation has several benefits for consumers:</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">On the one hand, it raises the level of protection and reduces errors in the perception of the drink due to incorrect labeling: it prevents the consumer from becoming confused about the type, origin, or quality of the drink he buys or consumes.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">It also seeks <strong>to prevent misleading practices by alcohol companies</strong>: it prevents companies from using false or misleading names, images, or claims to attract or mislead consumers.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">It also calls for <strong>greater market transparency and fair competition</strong>: it ensures that all producers and distributors comply with the same rules and conditions and respect consumers&#8217; rights and interests.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">The idea is that<strong> it allows for more informed and health-conscious decisions:</strong>by including nutritional information and allergens, consumers can better understand the energy value, nutrients and substances that can affect their health (such as sugars, saturated fats, or salt) that each drink contains.</p>



<p class="has-ast-global-color-7-color has-text-color">If you want to know more about the solution that Tapinpack offers for compliance with this regulation, do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
